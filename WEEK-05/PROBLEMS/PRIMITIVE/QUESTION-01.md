**Problem Name:Maximize the number of segments of length p, q and r.**


Given a rod of length L, the task is to cut the rod in such a way that the total number of segments of length p, q and r is maximized. The segments can only be of length p, q, and r.

**Examples:**

**Input:** l = 11, p = 2, q = 3, r = 5
**Output:** 5
Segments of 2, 2, 2, 2 and 3

**Input:** l = 7, p = 2, q = 5, r = 5
**Output:** 2
Segments of 2 and 5
