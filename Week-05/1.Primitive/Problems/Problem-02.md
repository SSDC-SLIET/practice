**Problem Name: Check for three consecutive numbers.**

Given an integer n, the task is to find whether n can be written as sum of three consecutive integer.

**Input:**
The first line of the input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test case follows, a single line of the input containing a positive integer N.


**Output:**
For each testcase, if it is possible to write as a sum of three consecutive integers  then print three consecutive integer, else print “-1”.

**Constraints:**

1<=T<=100
1<=N<=10000

**Examples:**

**Input:**

2

6

7

**Output:**

1 2 3

-1

**Explanation:**

Testcase 1: N = 6 can be written as 1+2+3.

Testcase 2: N = 7 can be written as a sum of three consecutives.
