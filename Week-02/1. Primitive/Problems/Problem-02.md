#**Replace all 0's with 5**

Given a number N. The task is to complete the function convertFive() which replace all zeros in the number with 5 and returns the number.

**Input:**
The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of testcases. Then T testcases follow. Each testcase contains a single integer N denoting the number.

**Output:**
The function will return integer where all zero's are converted to 5.

**User Task:**
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about input, you just have to complete the function convertFive().

**Constraints:**
1 <= T <= 103
1 <= N <= 104

**Example:**
**Input**
2
1004
121

**Output**
1554
121

**Explanation:**
Testcase 1:  At index 1 and 2 there is 0 so we replace it with 5.
Testcase 2: There is no ,0 so output will remain same.
