**Problem Name: Kth smallest element.**

Given an array arr[] and a number K where K is smaller than size of array, the task is to find the Kth smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

**Input:**

The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of testcases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines. First line of each testcase contains an integer N denoting size of the array. Second line contains N space separated integer denoting elements of the array. Third line of the test case contains an integer K.

**Output:**

Corresponding to each test case, print the kth smallest element in a new line.

**Constraints:**

1 <= T <= 100

1 <= N <= 105

1 <= arr[i] <= 105

1 <= K <= N

**Example:**

**Input:**

**Output:**

7

15


**Explanation:**

Testcase 1: 3rd smallest element in the given array is 7.
