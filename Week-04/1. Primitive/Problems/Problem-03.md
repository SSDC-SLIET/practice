# **Count the Zeros**

Given an array of size N consisting of only 0's and 1's ,which is sorted in such a manner that all the 1's are placed first and then they are followed by all the 0's. You have to find  the count of all the 0's.
 

**Input:**
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. 
The first line of each test case contains an integer N, where N is the size of the array A[ ].
The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers of all 1's follwed by all the 0's, denoting elements of the array A[ ].


**Output:**
Print out the number of 0's in the array. 
 

**Constraints:**
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 30
0 <= A[i] <= 1
 

Example :

**Input:**
3
12
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 
5
0 0 0 0 0
6
1 1 1 1 1 1


**Output:**
