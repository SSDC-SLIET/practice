# **Mr Modulo and Pairs**

Mr. Modulo comes up with another problem related to modulo and this time he is interested in finding all the possible pairs a and b in the array a[] such that a % b = k where k is a given integer. The array given will have distinct elements.
You are required to print how many such pairs exist.

**Input:**
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k, where n is the number of elements in the array a[]. Next line contains space separated n elements in the array a[].

**Output:**
Print an integer which is the total number of such pairs in the array.

**Constraints:**
1<=T<=10
2<=n<=1000
1<=k<=1000
1<=a[i]<=100000

**Example:**
**Input:**
1
5 3
2 3 5 4 7

**Output:**
4
