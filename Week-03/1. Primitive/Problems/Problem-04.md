#**Count pairs with given sum** 
Given an array of integers, and an integer  ‘K’ , find the count of pairs of elements in the array whose sum is equal to 'K'.

**Input:**
First line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. First line of each test case contains 2 space separated integers N and K denoting the size of array and the sum respectively. Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.

**Output:**
Print the count of pairs of elements in the array whose sum is equal to the K.

**Constraints:**
1<=T<=50
1<=N<=50
1<=K<=50
1<=A[i]<=100

**Example:**
**Input**
