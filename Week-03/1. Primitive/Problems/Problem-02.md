# **Replace all 0's with 5**
You are given an integer n. You need to convert all zeroes of n to 5.

**Input Format:**
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases . Then T test cases follow . Each test case contains a single integer n denoting the number.

**Output Format:**
The output of the function will be an integer where all zero's are converted to 5 .

**Your Task:**
Your task is to complete the function convertFive which takes an integer n as argument and replaces all zeros in the number n with 5 .Your function should return the converted number .

**Constraints:**
1 <= T < 100
1 <= n <= 10000

**Example:**
**Input**
2
1004
121
**Ouput**
1554
121

**Note:**The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.
